# LLM-as-a-Judge

LLM-as-a-Judge is the pattern of using a language model to evaluate outputs such as search results, recommendations, summaries, or generated answers against an explicit rubric. It does not eliminate human judgment; instead, it packages human intent into a calibrated evaluator that can run far more consistently and far more often than manual review alone.

## Why it works

The main advantage is consistency. A calibrated model can apply the same rubric across thousands of examples without the fatigue, shortcutting, and boundary drift that often appear in contractor or expert labeling pipelines. It can also catch synonym equivalence and latent semantic matches that are easy for rushed human raters to miss.

The second advantage is operational scale. Once a judge is reliable enough, teams can use it for daily monitoring, offline benchmarks, experiment comparisons, and pull-request guardrails instead of waiting for periodic annotation cycles.

In this vault, the pattern is especially relevant where retrieval and generation meet: [[Search-Augmented Language Models]], [[Retrieval-Augmented Generation]], and broader [[ML Systems at Scale]] pipelines all depend on evaluation loops that can keep up with production change.

## Key design principles

1. **Decompose relevance into facets.** Complex judgments are more reliable when split into narrow checks such as dish match, modifier match, or constraint satisfaction.
2. **Prefer binary checks to fuzzy multi-grade scales.** Binary decisions are easier to calibrate, easier to audit, and less vulnerable to disagreements around ambiguous middle buckets.
3. **Calibrate against a golden set.** The judge should be measured against adjudicated examples, not blindly trusted because it sounds plausible.
4. **Use structured criteria.** The G-EVAL result generalizes: explicit, step-by-step judging criteria tend to produce more reliable evaluations than unconstrained scoring prompts.
5. **Version the rubric.** Evaluation changes over time, so rubric updates and re-baselining need to be treated as part of the system, not as ad hoc prompt edits.

## DoorDash as a production case study

[[DoorDash - LLM-as-a-Judge for Search Evaluation]] is a strong production example. DoorDash found that natural-language search queries such as "cozy date night dinner" encode multiple interacting constraints that human annotators applied inconsistently. Their solution was a three-phase workflow: define facet-based rubrics, calibrate an LLM judge against a golden set, then automate evaluation for daily monitoring and PR-level regression checks.

The case study matters because it frames judge quality as a measurement-design problem rather than a model-magic problem. The LLM becomes useful when the rubric is explicit, the context is complete enough, and disagreements trigger rubric or prompt refinement instead of blind trust.

## Limitations

LLM judges still need human calibration, especially on edge cases where domain experts may reasonably disagree. They can inherit rubric mistakes, miss missing-context problems, and drift away from product reality if the evaluation prompt does not reflect what users actually see. In practice, the safest pattern is human-designed criteria, human adjudication on a golden set, and continuous re-calibration rather than fully autonomous judging.
