### **Compund AI**
:::

- ¬†[Compound AI](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/) systems integrate generative models with programmatic logic, data retrieval, and validation layers.
	-   Enables AI to fetch relevant data, combine tools, and produce more tailored outputs.
- **Example**: Insurance recommendation

 _Fig3: Simple RAG architecture_
- This process, known as¬†**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, dynamically incorporates external data into AI workflows..
	- However, it depends on **fixed workflows**, requiring predefined execution paths for every interaction.

# **How Design Patterns Shape Smarter Agents**
---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->

::: title
### **Reflection**
:::

- Agents assess and enhance their outputs before taking action or finalizing responses.
	- They identify mistakes, refine reasoning, and ensure high-quality outcomes.

### **Tool Use Expands Agent Capabilities**
:::

- Agents can interact with external tools to retrieve data, automate tasks, and execute workflows.
- Tool usage combines adaptive decision-making with predictable execution.

### **Planning Turns Goals Into Actions**
:::

- Agents decompose high-level goals into structured, actionable steps.
- Ideal for multi-step problem-solving and handling task dependencies.

### **Multi-Agent Collaboration: Modular Thinking**
:::

- Assigns specific tasks to specialized agents for efficient problem-solving.
- Keeps individual agents focused, reducing complexity.
- A related technique is¬†[Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)](https://huggingface.co/blog/moe), which employs specialized submodels, or ‚Äúexperts‚Äù, within a single framework.
	- Dynamically routes tasks to specialized submodels, optimizing resources and performance.

# **The Challenges with Scaling Intelligent Agents**
---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-3-2]]" -->

::: title
### **Challenges**
:::

::: left
 - Scaling agents ‚Äî whether individually or within a collaborative system, depends on their ability to seamlessly access and share data.
- Connecting agents to necessary tools and data is essentially a **distributed systems challenge**.
	- This resembles the complexities of designing microservices, where components must communicate efficiently while avoiding bottlenecks and rigid dependencies.
-  While connecting agents and tools via RPC and APIs is possible, it often leads to tightly coupled systems.
	- Tight coupling can hinder scalability, adaptability, and the ability to support multiple data consumers.

#### üìù**Agents must have the flexibility to access other agents, services, and platforms without being constrained by rigid dependencies.**

# **What's the Solution?**
---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-3-2]]" -->

::: title
### **Event-Driven Architectures (EDA)**
:::

::: left
 - In the early days, software systems were monolithic ‚Äî everything existed within a single, tightly integrated codebase.
- Microservices revolutionized this by breaking applications into smaller, independently deployable components, though it introduced the challenge of tight coupling.
-  EDA solved the problem.
	- EDA allows components to communicate asynchronously via events.
	-  Services no longer depend on each other‚Äôs completion ‚Äî they react to real-time events as they happen.

#### üìùThe future of AI isn‚Äôt just about building smarter agents; it‚Äôs about creating systems that can evolve and scale with advancing technology ‚Äî EDA forms the foundation for this future.

### **Agents as Microservices with Informational Dependencies**
:::

- Agents share similarities with microservices but go a step further.
	- While microservices handle discrete operations, agents leverage shared, context-rich information to reason, make decisions, and collaborate.
- For example, an agent could pull customer data from a CRM, analyze live analytics, and interact with external tools, all while updating other agents.
	- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) can address this challenge by serving as the central nervous system for data.

### **Decoupling While Keeping Context Intact**
:::

- Today‚Äôs AI stack includes MLOps managing pipelines, data scientists selecting models, and developers building interfaces.
- Tightly coupled designs introduce dependencies that slow down delivery and hinder adaptability.
- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) keeps workflows loosely coupled, enabling each team to innovate independently.
	- Application layers don't need to know the inner workings of AI ‚Äî they simply consume results as needed.

### **Scaling Agents with Event-Driven Architecture**
:::
::: left
- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is the backbone of the transition to agent-based systems.
- As discussed¬†[here](https://hubertdulay.substack.com/p/event-driven-agent-mesh), platforms like Kafka demonstrate the key benefits of EDA in an agent-driven system:
	- Horizontal Scalability
	- Low Latency
	- Loose Coupling
	- Event Persistence
-  This architecture is a natural fit for frameworks like Anthropic‚Äôs¬†[Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)¬†(MCP).
	- MCP offers a universal standard for integrating AI systems with external tools, data sources, and applications, ensuring secure, real-time access to the latest information.
	- MCP minimizes development effort while enabling context-aware decision-making.

#### üìù**EDA addresses many of the challenges MCP aims to solve**

- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) enables flexible, scalable, and resilient AI systems.
- EDA ensures seamless integration and real-time workflows.
- Adopting EDA provides a competitive edge‚Äîthose who don‚Äôt risk falling behind.
