Every agent you've built has the same problem. An LLM that costs $0.03 per call sits in a loop answering yes-or-no questions, picking the next worker, and scoring relevance.

Those decisions don't need generation. They need a model that was built to decide.

This is the 10-step setup that gives your agents a dedicated decision brain. Install it once. Measure it. Then replace every expensive fork.

The Jevons Paradox is a rule from 1865: when a steam engine uses coal more efficiently, total coal consumption goes up, not down.

> Follow my Substack to get fresh AI alpha:[movez.substack.com](https://movez.substack.com/)

That is the global problem for AI. Tokens get cheaper every quarter. Usage explodes. The bill stays the same or grows. Jev by [@typesafeai](https://x.com/@typesafeai) is built to break this cycle.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HSg7Jn3W0AEh1JU?format=jpg&name=large)

It is a System One model: you send it state and predefined questions, it returns typed answers with probabilities. No text generation. No chat. No autoregressive loop.

It does one thing. It decides. And it does it 200x faster and 400x cheaper than an LLM doing the same job.

## 01\. Split - find the decisions, not the text

Jev is TypeSafe AI's System One model. You provide information and predefined questions. It returns typed answers with probabilities. It cannot write your briefing, generate code, or explain its reasoning in prose.

Start with a job like this:

```python
Research three new AI-agent tools and draft tomorrow's briefing. Save 
the draft for my review.
```

That job contains several decisions: Do we have enough sources? Which worker goes next? Is the draft ready for review?

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HSg_2kNXIAAs1Xm?format=png&name=large)

Those are candidates for Jev. Fetching sources, writing paragraphs, and saving files still belong to your tools and generative models. An exact rule, such as stopping after ten actions, belongs in code.

The split is simple. If the operation creates text, it stays with the LLM. If the operation picks an option from a list, scores a value, or answers yes/no, it goes to Jev.

## 02\. Playground - test one question before code

Open the TypeSafe Playground. Sign in and complete the access process if your account requires it.

Use this as your state & Add a question: "Which worker should act next?"

```python
{
  "goal": "Compare three AI-agent tools in a morning briefing.",
  "completed_work": "No sources collected yet.",
  "available_workers": ["Researcher", "Writer"],
  "constraint": "Save drafts for review. Do not publish."
}
```

> Define three options:

- **research** for missing evidence,
- **write** for drafting from sufficient evidence
- **review** for unclear requests or completed work.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HSg8c5IXgAARk_C?format=jpg&name=large)

Run it. Then replace the completed-work field with actual research notes and compare the decision. This is the basic interaction described in the official Quickstart.

## 03\. SDK - install and connect the API

You need a TypeSafe account with API access enabled and a key from key settings. API calls are billed to that account.

Install Python 3.12 or newer, then open Terminal.

```python
$ mkdir jev-starter
$ cd jev-starter
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ .venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade typesafe-sdk
```

```python
> mkdir jev-starter
> cd jev-starter
> py -3 -m venv .venv
> .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade typesafe-sdk
```

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HShBwFSW4AA9z4p?format=jpg&name=large)

With Node.js/npm installed, add TypeSafe's official skill:

```python
npx skills add typesafe-ai/skills --skill typesafe-ai
```

Select your supported agent when prompted. The skill gives it integration instructions. Jev itself runs through the API.

## 04\. Handoff - save decisions as local JSON queues

Create [chief.py](https://chief.py/) inside jev-starter, outside .venv. This is the standalone decision router: enter a job, let Jev choose its destination, save the handoff on your computer.

```python
import json
import os
from getpass import getpass
from pathlib import Path
from uuid import uuid4
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, TypeSafeAPIError, TypeSafeClient

if not os.environ.get("TYPESAFE_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["TYPESAFE_API_KEY"] = getpass("TypeSafe API key: ").strip()

goal = input("Goal: ").strip()
if not goal:
    raise SystemExit("Enter a goal.")
notes = input("Completed work: ").strip() or "Nothing yet."
state = {"goal": goal, "completed_work": notes}

try:
    with TypeSafeClient(model="jev-1.13.0") as client:
        result = client.system_one(
            state=state,
            questions={
                "next_worker": Choice(
                    instructions="Choose the next step for a research briefing.",
                    criteria={
                        "research": "Collect evidence still needed for the goal.",
                        "write": "Draft the briefing from sufficient evidence.",
                        "review": "Goal unclear, outside scope, or work complete.",
                    },
                )
            },
        )
except TypeSafeAPIError as error:
    raise SystemExit(f"API error {error.status}; see Step 8.")

answer = result.choices["next_worker"]
destination = "review"
if answer.choice in {"research", "write"} and answer.confidence >= 0.85:
    destination = answer.choice

folder = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "queue" / destination
folder.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
job = folder / f"{uuid4().hex}.json"
payload = dict(state, choice=answer.choice, confidence=answer.confidence,
               destination=destination, status="queued")
job.write_text(json.dumps(payload, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False), encoding="utf-8")
print("Saved handoff:", job)
```

```python
$ .venv/bin/python chief.py
TypeSafe API key: ••••••••••
Goal: Compare three AI-agent tools for tomorrow's briefing
Completed work: No sources collected yet
Saved handoff: /Users/you/jev-starter/queue/research/a3f8...json
```

Open that JSON file. It contains your request, progress, Jev's choice, confidence, and destination. Each run creates a new file under queue/research, queue/write, or queue/review.

These are local task queues. A saved job waits for a worker to consume it.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HSg8_FqWsAAg2oG?format=png&name=large)

The confidence threshold is set to 0.85. Adjust it using labeled examples from your workflow. Confidence is not an accuracy percentag\\

## 05\. Questions - Choice, Score, and Noul

Jev gives you three question types, each built for a different kind of decision:

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HSg9IGgW8AARuSJ?format=png&name=large)

A useful detail: Jev does not see your question ID. Naming a field safe\_to\_publish contributes no instructions. Put the actual requirement in the question and describe each option clearly.

Also supply evidence. "The researcher finished" tells Jev less than the sources, findings, and remaining gaps. Keep those fields separate from the original request

System One models evaluate every question in a request in parallel. Adding questions barely changes the response time and costs only the tokens for the extra questions.

## 06\. Dynamic Menu - rebuild options every turn

A browser's available actions change after every click. Browser Use builds a fresh list of observed controls and lets Jev choose from that list. A small LLM generates text only when an input field needs filling.

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/HShCJzzXAAAu7lk.jpg?name=large)

GIF

Apply that design to your Chief of Staff. Build the choices from workers that exist and are available now. Include the current source IDs when selecting research material.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HSg9al7XkAAN46S?format=png&name=large)

Refresh the options after a tool changes the state. Otherwise your decision model is choosing from yesterday's menu.

## 07\. Parallel - batch questions in one call

Your dispatcher may need a worker, an urgency score, and an approval check. If all three can inspect the same state, send them together.

TypeSafe supports parallel questions and speculative branches: ask about possible next actions, then use only the answer relevant to the selected branch.

Questions cannot read one another's answers. If a decision needs a fresh search result, perform the search first.

```python
result = client.system_one(
    state=state,
    questions={
        "next_worker": Choice(
            instructions="Choose the next step.",
            criteria={...}
        ),
        "urgency": Score(
            instructions="Rate request urgency.",
            labels=["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]
        ),
        "safe_to_run": Noul(
            instructions="The requested action is safe to execute without human review."
        ),
    },
)
```

The Browser Use example exposes another bottleneck. Its optimized runtime reduced median browser protocol calls from 1,092 to 101, while median task time fell 25% across three matched pairs. Both versions used the same models.

The changes included collecting the page state in one read and avoiding fresh predictions for irrelevant animations. Inspect repeated tool calls before paying for a faster model.

## 08\. Guardrails - set limits and stop conditions

For a morning briefing, allow source collection and draft creation, then stop at review. Publishing should require a separate permission check.

The application also needs an action limit, a spending limit, and saved progress. After an interruption, it should inspect the last completed action before repeating anything. A confident answer cannot prove that a file was saved or a message was sent.

Browser Use independently checks the outcome after Jev selects DONE. Borrow that separation for your own completion checks.

```python
AGENT HANDOFF BRIEF

Read the TypeSafe skill and inspect my worker interfaces. Connect 
chief.py's JSON queues to existing research and writing handlers. 

Prevent duplicate processing. Save progress after each action. Add 
call and spending limits, review on uncertainty, and a draft-exists 
completion check. Keep publishing behind approval. Identify missing 
connectors explicitly.
```

If the starter fails, use the error to choose the fix:

> **DEEP DIVE // THE JEV HARNESS**

Agents run in a loop: an LLM decides what to do, a tool executes, a model evaluates the result, and the loop continues until the task is done. Two primitives made this easier: tool calling for structured requests and structured outputs for structured results.

But even with those in place, every decision in that loop still costs a full model call.

That is where the harness matters more than the model.

> The harness is the difference between 78% and 42% on the same model. Same weights. Different loop engineering. The harness decides the performance.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HSg-DDZW8AAjsZw?format=png&name=large)

Coding harnesses like Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor have shipped some kind of way to classify dangerous actions before they're taken.

That classifier step has slowly helped build trust in agents. Until now, it was locked away in the closed-source parts of the harness.

Now that a cheap and performant classifier model exists, you can take the same pattern and adopt it to all agents.

> Same model. Same tools. Different harness. Different results.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HShCz1EXYAA5L7k?format=png&name=large)

LangChain's AutoModeMiddleware uses Jev to check every tool call for risky decisions before the tool executes. One line of middleware. Zero generation tokens burned on safety checks.

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain_typesafe.experimental.middleware import (
    AutoModeMiddleware,
)

# Jev checks every tool call before execution
# Blocks risky actions, approves safe ones
guardrail = AutoModeMiddleware(tools=["bash"])

agent = create_agent("openai:gpt-5.6-luna", middleware=[guardrail])
```

The harness gives you two layers of Jev. The model router at the top picks the cheapest model that can handle the request. The Auto Mode gate at the bottom blocks dangerous tool calls before they execute.

Neither layer generates text. Neither layer adds latency you can feel. Both run on the same [$0.042-per-million](https://x.com/search?q=%240.042-per-million&src=cashtag_click) pricing.

## 09\. Cost - what $0.042 per million buys

Jev 1.13 costs $0.042 per million input tokens, with no output-token charge. At 1,000 billed input tokens per decision, 10,000 decisions cost $0.42 for Jev inference.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HShDN30XcAAoiHx?format=jpg&name=large)

The flight demo's reported $0.0039 fits its recorded 90,558 Jev input tokens plus the text helper's reported charge. Browser costs sit outside that calculation. Its roughly seven-second clock starts after the initial page observation and excludes fresh post-run verification.

It finds flight results. It does not book tickets.

For a different workload, Vercel's fx team reported roughly 5-18x faster safety classification than GPT-5.6-Luna, alongside improved accuracy.

That comparison concerns the classifier, not the duration of an entire agent run.

> We believe that the future is code + AI, so made workflow evals to reflect that Jev costs: $42 / BILLION input tokens ($0.042 / MTok) and output tokens are free (forever - they’re too cheap to meter with our new architecture) Jev is named after Jevons paradox and off the

Track the bill per completed task. A cheap decision that sends a worker down the wrong branch can cost more than the decision itself.

## 10\. Deploy - five production use cases

After the basic setup, Jev can already read the state of a task and choose between predefined options. Now you only need to decide which repeated decision to automate.

> **01\. Control a Browser**

Browser Use used Jev to select the next action and the correct page element. The agent found flights in 7 seconds for $0.0039.

> Sep 17
> 
> Breaking: Browser Use + Jev = Ultrafast Findings flights took 7s and cost only $0.0039 > new action space every step > DOM state space > small LLM fallback to type (this video is at 1x speed btw) Built a tiny open source browser agent. try it below ↓

**How to repeat:**

Run the official Browser Use project, add your TypeSafe and OpenRouter keys, then give the agent a website and a goal. Jev selects the action and target. The browser executes the decision.

> **02\. Classify Research:**

Hassan used Jev to classify 1,018 AI research papers. The entire classification cost $0.08, with 256ms median end-to-end latency per paper.

> Sep 17
> 
> Jev + Kimi K3 for fraud detection! TLDR: Jev classified 100 emails in 1.42 seconds, then I routed the uncertain cases to Kimi K3. The full pipeline got 96/100 correct for only ~$0.07. Video is not sped up, check out the live run! Here was my process: I gave Jev 100 emails to

**How to repeat:**

Send the title and summary of each paper to Jev, then define your topics as Choice options. Save the selected category and send the strongest papers to your writing agent.

> **03\. Triage Your Inbox:**

Riley Brown demonstrated how Jev can classify incoming emails and decide what should happen next. 500 emails classified for 3.5 cents.

> Sep 17
> 
> Yeah Jev by @typesafeai is very cool. It classified 500 emails in seconds. And it costed 3.5 cents.

**How to repeat:**

Pass each email as the state, then add reply, research, wait, and review as Choice options. Connect each answer to the corresponding folder or email agent.

> **04\. Route Tasks Between Models:**

LangChain uses Jev to choose between cheaper and more capable models based on the task. Simple tasks go to a fast model. Complex tasks go to a reasoning model.

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain_typesafe.experimental.middleware import (
    ModelChoice, ModelRouterMiddleware,
)

router = ModelRouterMiddleware(
    choices={
        "fast": ModelChoice(
            model="openai:luna",
            criteria="Direct lookups, extraction, localized changes.",
        ),
        "powerful": ModelChoice(
            model="openai:sol",
            criteria="Architecture and high-stakes decisions.",
        ),
    },
    instructions="Choose the least costly model that can complete the task.",
)

agent = create_agent("openai:gpt-5.6-luna", middleware=[router])
```

> **05\. Instant Context Compaction**

Tamara found the perfect use case: instant compaction. In 2026, why is compaction still a summarization prompt? Jev can make it instant by scoring every tool call and dropping what's irrelevant.

> Sep 18
> 
> found the perfect use case for @typesafeai Jev: instant compaction in 2026, why is compaction still a summarization prompt? Jev can make it instant by scoring every tool call and dropping what’s irrelevant

Alex Volkov tested it: 1 second to compact a Claude session from nearly 1M tokens to 86K. That is not a summarization pass. That is a relevance filter at Jev speed

> Sep 18
> 
> This is actually insane. This uses @typesafeai Jev model, as a plugin in Claude to review all the un-nesseasary tool calls, and it takes 1s to run! Like, literally, 1 second to take my Claude session from nearly 1M to ... 86K tokens! Ask your claude to install it and be

## Conclusion:

Jev is not another chatbot. It is a fast decision layer that reads the current state of your system and chooses between the options you define.

And the real alpha is not the 7-second flight demo or the $0.08 paper classification.

The real alpha is realizing how many expensive LLM calls inside your agents never needed generation:

Let the LLM research, plan, and write. Let Jev route, score, approve, or escalate. Let code execute the decision.

That split changes the entire agent stack.

You now have the setup, the working decision router, and four real ways to deploy it. Start with one repeated decision. Measure it. Then replace the next one.

Most builders will keep spending frontier-model tokens on every yes, no, route, and score.

The few who separate thinking from deciding will build faster agents at a fraction of the cost.
