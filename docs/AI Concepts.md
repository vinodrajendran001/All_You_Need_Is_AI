### **Step 1: Learning Roadmap**

The roadmap is structured in 5 major domains: NLP, Computer Vision (CV), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Each domain is divided into foundational concepts, intermediate topics, and advanced areas. Models, architectures, mathematics, hands-on resources, and research papers are integrated throughout.
