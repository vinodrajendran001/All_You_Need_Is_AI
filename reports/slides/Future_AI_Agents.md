::: title
### **Compund AI**
:::

- ¬†[Compound AI](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/) systems integrate generative models with programmatic logic, data retrieval, and validation layers.
	-   Enables AI to fetch relevant data, combine tools, and produce more tailored outputs.
- **Example**: Insurance recommendation

 _Fig3: Simple RAG architecture_
- This process, known as¬†**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, dynamically incorporates external data into AI workflows..
	- However, it depends on **fixed workflows**, requiring predefined execution paths for every interaction.

-   **Agents enable dynamic, context-driven workflows**
    -   Unlike fixed paths, they determine next steps in real time, adapting to changing situations.

-   **Shifting control logic**
    -   Agents can **reason, utilize tools, and access memory** dynamically, redefining traditional AI workflows.

# **How Design Patterns Shape Smarter Agents**
---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->

::: title
### **Reflection**
:::

- Agents assess and enhance their outputs before taking action or finalizing responses.
	- Enables agents to catch and correct mistakes, refine their reasoning, and ensure higher-quality outcomes.

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->

::: title
### **Tool Use Expands Agent Capabilities**
:::

- Interfacing with external tools extends an agent‚Äôs functionality, allowing it to perform tasks like retrieving data, automating processes, or executing deterministic workflows.
- Tool use bridges the gap between flexible decision-making and predictable, reliable execution.

### **Planning Turns Goals Into Actions**
:::

- Agents with planning capabilities can break down high-level objectives into actionable steps, organizing tasks in a logical sequence.
- Useful for solving multi-step problems or managing workflows with dependencies.

::: title
### **Multi-Agent Collaboration: Modular Thinking**
:::

- Multi-agent systems take a modular approach to problem-solving by assigning specific tasks to specialized agents.
- The modular design reduces complexity for individual agents by keeping their context focused on their specific tasks.
- A related technique is¬†[Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)](https://huggingface.co/blog/moe), which employs specialized submodels, or ‚Äúexperts,‚Äù within a single framework.
	- MoE dynamically routes tasks to the most relevant expert, optimizing computational resources and enhancing performance.

---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->

::: title
### **Agentic RAG**
:::

- Agents can determine in real time what data they need, where to find it, and how to refine their queries based on the task at hand.
- Well-suited for handling complex, multi-step workflows that require responsiveness and adaptability.
- **Example**: An agent creating a marketing strategy

# **The Challenges with Scaling Intelligent Agents**
---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-3-2]]" -->

::: title
### **Challenges**
:::

::: left
 - Scaling agents ‚Äî whether a single agent or a collaborative system ‚Äî hinges on their ability to access and share data effortlessly.
- Connecting agents to the tools and data they need is fundamentally a¬†**distributed systems problem**.
	- Mirrors the challenges faced in designing microservices, where components must communicate efficiently without creating bottlenecks or rigid dependencies.
-  You could connect agents and tools through RPC and APIs, but that‚Äôs a recipe for tightly coupled systems.
	- Tight coupling makes it harder to scale, adapt, or support multiple consumers of the same data.

#### üìù**Agents need flexibility in accessing other agents, services, and platforms without any rigid dependencies.**

# **What's the Solution?**
---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-3-2]]" -->

::: title
### **Event-Driven Architectures (EDA)**
:::

::: left
 - In the early days, software systems were monoliths -> Everything lived in a single, tightly integrated codebase.
- Microservices changed this
	- By breaking applications into smaller, independently deployable component but comes with a challenge of **Tight coupling**
-  EDA solved the problem.
	- EDA enables components to communicate asynchronously through events.
	- Services don‚Äôt wait on each other ‚Äî they react to what‚Äôs happening in real-time.

#### üìùThe future of AI isn‚Äôt just about building smarter agents ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating systems that can evolve and scale as the technology advances -> EDA is the foundation for this future**

### **Agents as Microservices with Informational Dependencies**
:::

- Agents are similar to microservices but they go further.
	- While microservices typically process discrete operations, agents rely on shared, context-rich information to reason, make decisions, and collaborate.
- For instance, an agent might pull customer data from a CRM, analyze live analytics, and use external tools ‚Äî all while sharing updates with other agents.
	- EDA can solve this challenge by acting as a **central nervous system** for data.

::: title
### **Decoupling While Keeping Context Intact**
:::

- Today's AI stack involves MLOps managing pipelines, data scientists selecting models, and developers building interfaces.
- A tightly coupled design creates dependencies, slowing delivery and adaptability.
- EDA ensures that workflows stay loosely coupled, allowing each team to innovate independently.
	- Application layers don‚Äôt need to understand the AI‚Äôs internals ‚Äî they simply consume results when needed.

::: title
### **Scaling Agents with Event-Driven Architecture**
:::

::: left
 - EDA is the backbone of this transition to agentic systems.
- As discussed¬†[here](https://hubertdulay.substack.com/p/event-driven-agent-mesh), platforms like Kafka exemplify the advantages of EDA in an agent-driven system:
	- Horizontal Scalability
	- Low Latency
	- Loose Coupling
	- Event Persistence
-  This architecture is a natural fit for frameworks like Anthropic‚Äôs¬†[Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)¬†(MCP).
	- MCP provides a universal standard for integrating AI systems with external tools, data sources, and applications, ensuring secure and seamless access to up-to-date information.
	- MCP reduces development effort while enabling context-aware decision-making.

#### üìù**EDA addresses many of the challenges MCP aims to solve**

- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) enables flexible, scalable, and resilient AI systems.
- EDA ensures seamless integration and real-time workflows.
- Adopting EDA provides a competitive edge‚Äîthose who don‚Äôt risk falling behind.
