 ### AI agents: the perfect use case

- Imagine you are building a system to analyze financial documents. Instead of using one large model, you can break the task into several specialized agents:

 ##### closing thoughts

- **SLM agents can significantly reduce costs, improve accuracy, and simplify compliance with regulatory requirements.**
- You don’t need to completely abandon LLMs – **you can gradually replace only some components with SLMs**
- In the end, the **key to success is to adapt**. Start with a large model, evaluate where it performs best, and then optimize your architecture to avoid overpaying for unnecessary capabilities and compromising data privacy.
