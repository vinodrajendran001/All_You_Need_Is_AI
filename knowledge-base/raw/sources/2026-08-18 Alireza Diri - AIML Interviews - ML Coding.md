## 2\. ML/Data Coding 🤖

ML coding rounds vary by company. Some focus on implementing classical algorithms from scratch, while others test practical Python and PyTorch skills such as tensor operations, preprocessing, metrics, and training loops. In either format, interviewers evaluate correctness, numerical stability, code quality, edge-case handling, complexity, and your ability to explain design choices.

## How to use this chapter

- Use [`solutions/ml_algorithms.py`](https://github.com/alirezadir/AIMLInterviews/blob/main/src/MLC/solutions/ml_algorithms.py) as the canonical, executable NumPy reference for core interview problems.
- Run [`solutions/test_ml_algorithms.py`](https://github.com/alirezadir/AIMLInterviews/blob/main/src/MLC/solutions/test_ml_algorithms.py) to verify the implementations and study useful edge cases.
- Use the older [notebooks](https://github.com/alirezadir/AIMLInterviews/blob/main/src/MLC/notebooks) as supplementary, exploratory material. Some predate the canonical solutions and may be less complete.
- Practice writing each priority problem without looking at the reference, then compare correctness, complexity, and edge-case handling.

## Difficulty and company tags

Every coding question uses a LeetCode-style difficulty label:

- **Easy:** Usually one core operation, limited state, and a focused implementation that should take about 15 minutes.
- **Medium:** Multiple steps or non-trivial edge cases; a strong interview implementation usually takes 20–35 minutes.
- **Hard:** A 40–60+ minute problem involving several interacting components, advanced debugging, or systems-level trade-offs.

Difficulty is an editorial judgment about the complete prompt in this repository, not a claim that every source rates an equivalent problem identically. Exact matches were calibrated against [TorchLeet](https://github.com/Exorust/TorchLeet) and [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems); unmatched prompts were rated with the same rubric. When sources disagree, the scope and required edge cases of this repository’s prompt determine the final label.

Company tags are added only when a reference associates a company with the same implementation problem. They are historical preparation signals, not a guarantee that the company currently asks the question. Only metadata facts are used; no third-party problem statements or solutions are copied.

Run the reference tests from the repository root:

```
uv run --with numpy python src/MLC/solutions/test_ml_algorithms.py
```

## PyTorch ML Coding

Modern ML coding interviews may test practical PyTorch skills rather than only asking candidates to implement algorithms from scratch. The [PyTorch ML Coding Problems](https://github.com/alirezadir/AIMLInterviews/blob/main/src/MLC/pytorch-ml-coding.md) guide includes:

- A 60-minute mock interview covering tensors, preprocessing, metrics, training/evaluation loops, and debugging
- Python utility and clean-code questions for ML workflows
- Tensor operations, datasets, batching, device handling, and autograd
- Training, optimization, mixed precision, checkpointing, and reproducibility
- Testing, debugging, deployment, and advanced PyTorch questions
- Coding challenges and concise reference responses

## What to explain during the interview

1. State input shapes, dtypes, assumptions, and expected outputs before coding.
2. Start with a correct baseline, then vectorize or optimize the bottleneck.
3. Discuss time and space complexity, including the cost of pairwise matrices.
4. Handle numerical stability, empty inputs, ties, constant features, and invalid labels.
5. Write small tests for normal cases and at least one failure or boundary case.
6. Explain how the implementation would change for large datasets, GPUs, distributed training, or production libraries.
