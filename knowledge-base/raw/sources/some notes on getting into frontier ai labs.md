A few days ago I wrote that getting into a frontier AI lab mostly comes down to two things: proven research and trench engineering.

The more I think about it, the less these feel like separate skills.

Both are expressions of the same underlying ability.

Most of education is built around known answers. The textbook knows the answer. The professor knows the answer. The interviewer usually knows the answer. Even difficult problems are often exercises in recovering something that already exists.

Frontier labs operate in a different regime.

Nobody knows the answer.

Nobody knows which architectural decisions will look obvious in five years. Nobody knows which bottlenecks are fundamental. Nobody knows which capabilities are missing. Nobody knows which assumptions will survive the next generation of models.

The map is incomplete.

This is why research matters.

People often think research is valuable because it produces papers. Papers are merely the visible artifact. The deeper purpose of research is that it trains a person to operate without a map. You start with uncertainty, form a hypothesis, confront reality, discover that reality disagrees, update your beliefs, and repeat.

The output is not the paper.

The output is a refined ability to make progress when certainty is unavailable.

The engineering side is surprisingly similar.

People often imagine trench engineering as exceptional coding ability. The phrase usually evokes someone moving quickly through enormous codebases, solving difficult bugs, or writing highly optimized systems.

But I think the deeper skill is something else.

As systems grow, expertise undergoes a transition.

It stops being about accumulation and starts becoming about compression.

A student can understand an entire class project. An early startup engineer can understand most of the company's infrastructure. But eventually systems become too detailed for any individual to hold in their head simultaneously.

Modern AI infrastructure resembles a city more than a machine.

New districts are constantly being built. Old roads remain because too many other things depend on them. Some areas are carefully designed. Others emerged from historical accidents. Different people understand different neighborhoods. Nobody possesses a perfectly accurate map of the whole thing.

Understanding becomes distributed.

The challenge is no longer learning every detail.

The challenge is constructing a useful abstraction.

Physicists do not simulate every molecule in a hurricane. They create concepts such as pressure, temperature, and velocity. These abstractions discard nearly all available information while preserving the information that matters.

Without abstraction there is no understanding.

Great engineers operate the same way.

When they encounter a system containing millions of lines of code, they are not trying to understand every component. They are searching for the small number of ideas that explain the behavior of the larger system.

Which assumptions does everything depend on?

Where are the bottlenecks?

Which subsystem exerts the most influence?

Which details can safely be ignored?

The goal is not comprehensive knowledge.

The goal is a compressed model that predicts reality.

This is why experienced engineers often seem almost unnaturally effective. They are not evaluating every possibility. They are eliminating possibilities. Their mental models are organized around causal structure. They know which facts explain other facts.

In a large distributed training system, there may be hundreds of plausible explanations for a failure. The best engineers rarely investigate all of them. They rapidly narrow the search space because they understand where leverage exists.

Research and engineering begin to look surprisingly similar when viewed through this lens.

A researcher is confronted with an overwhelming number of possible experiments. Every paper suggests three new directions. Every result raises more questions than it answers. The challenge is not generating possibilities; the challenge is deciding which possibility deserves attention. The history of science is full of examples where progress came not from solving a difficult problem, but from recognizing the importance of a problem that everyone else overlooked. Richard Hamming often argued that great scientists distinguish themselves less by intelligence than by working on important questions. Before a breakthrough can be discovered, someone has to identify where the breakthrough is likely to be hiding.

Engineering operates under a remarkably similar dynamic. Large systems produce an endless supply of anomalies, bottlenecks, bugs, performance regressions, and unexpected behaviors. Most are unimportant. Some are symptoms rather than causes. A few reveal something fundamental about the system. The engineer's task is not to investigate every possibility. It is to rapidly reduce the search space and focus attention on the handful of explanations that are capable of explaining everything else.

In both cases, the scarce resource is not information.

It is judgment.

Herbert Simon observed that intelligence is constrained by bounded rationality: the world contains far more information than any individual can process. As a result, expertise is not the ability to consider every possibility. Expertise is the ability to discard most possibilities while retaining the ones that matter. The best researchers and engineers develop an intuition for where the signal is likely to be found long before they possess complete information.

Seen this way, frontier AI labs are selecting for something deeper than raw intelligence. They are selecting for people who can build useful abstractions in environments where understanding is incomplete. Research is, in some sense, the compression of uncertainty. Engineering is the compression of complexity. Both involve taking a reality that is far too large to reason about directly and reducing it to a model that is simple enough to guide action while remaining faithful to the underlying structure.

This becomes increasingly important as models grow more capable. Knowledge is becoming cheaper. Access to information is becoming cheaper. Even the production of code is becoming cheaper. What remains scarce is the ability to decide what deserves attention in the first place. Which research direction is worth another six months? Which anomalous result is worth investigating? Which subsystem deserves another week of engineering effort? These decisions cannot be automated away by simply providing more information. They require taste, judgment, and an understanding of the system's underlying structure.

Most people describe frontier AI as a race for intelligence.

I increasingly suspect it is a race for better abstractions.
